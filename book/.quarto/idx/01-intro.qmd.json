The old distinctions between research traditions are being erased and a new field is emerging:\n\n> **In the past decade, a field we now call \"computational ethology\" has begun to take shape**. It involves the use of machine vision and machine learning to measure and analyze the patterns of action generated by animals in contexts designed to evoke ecologically relevant behaviors [@anderson_toward_2014]. Technical progress in statistical inference and deep learning, the democratization of high-performance computing (due to falling hardware costs and the ability to rent GPUs and CPUs in the cloud), and new and creative ideas about how to apply technology to measuring naturalistic behavior have dramatically accelerated progress in this research area. [@datta_computational_2019]\n\n![Scientific disciplines converging on markerless motion tracking methods.](img/fields_converge_on_tracking.png){#fig-fields-converge}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Discuss\"}\n\n- Which scientific disciplines do you represent?\n- What species are you working with?\n- Have you witnessed an increasing use of markerless tracking methods in your field?\n:::\n\n## The computational (neuro)ethology workflow\n\nThe rise of markerless methods has reconfigured the data acquisition and analysis workflows for scientists interested in measuring animal behaviour:\n\n- Video recordings are the primary data source.\n- Computer vision tools (most often based on deep learning) are used to extract user-defined features from video frames and track them over time.\n- The resulting tracks can then be used to quantify various aspects of motion, such as speed, orientation, distance travelled, etc.\n- The motion tracks, video features and derived kinematic features may serve as input for behaviour segmentation algorithms.\n\n![An overview of modern computational ethology workflows](img/ethology_workflow.png){#fig-ethology-workflow}\n\nAn ecosystem of open-source tools has emerged to support this workflow. See @luxem_open-source_2023, @pereira_quantifying_2020, @blau_study_2024 for comprehensive reviews. We also provide a non-exhaustive list of open-source tools in [@sec-useful-tools].\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Where does the 'neuro' come in?\" collapse=true}\n\nNeuroscientists are increasingly interested in precisely quantifying naturalistic behaviour, for several reasons:\n\n> if we are to understand how the brain works, we need to think about the actual problems it evolved to solve. Addressing this challenge means studying natural behavior — the kinds of behaviors generated by animals when they are free to act on their own internally-generated goals without physical or psychological restraint ([source: Datta Lab website](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/research/overview/)).\n>\n> …detailed examination of brain parts or their selective perturbation is not sufficient to understand how the brain generates behavior [@krakauer_neuroscience_2017].\n>\n> The behavioral work needs to be as fine-grained as work at the neural level. Otherwise one is imperiled by a granularity mismatch between levels… [@krakauer_neuroscience_2017].\n\nThis shift in focus within neuroscience has been a major driver for the rapid development of the computational approaches described above.\nSome refer to this field as **computational neuroethology**—the science of quantifying naturalistic behaviours to understand the brain [@datta_computational_2019].\n\nThe data acquisition and analysis workflows used in computational neuroethology are similar to those shown in @fig-ethology-workflow.\nThe key difference is that derived measures of behaviour—whether continuous variables like speed or discrete actions such as \"grooming\"—are ultimately analysed alongside neural data, such as spike trains or calcium imaging traces (@fig-neuroethology-workflow).\n\n![An overview of modern computational neuroethology workflows.](img/neuroethology_workflow.png){#fig-neuroethology-workflow}\n\nHighly **recommended readings**:\n\n- @krakauer_neuroscience_2017\n- @datta_computational_2019\n- @pereira_quantifying_2020\n\n:::\n\n## The scope of this course\n\nWe will start with a primer on deep learning for computer vision (@sec-dl-cv), going over the key concepts and technologies that underpin most markerless tracking approaches.\n\nAfter that we could take a whirlwind tour through all the stages of a computaional ethology workflow [@fig-ethology-workflow] and the various tools available for each step. However, since we want this to work as a two-day hands-on workshop with plenty of time for exercises and active learning, we have instead chosen to focus on two key steps:\n\n- [@sec-sleap]: Pose estimation and tracking with [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) [@pereira_sleap_2022]. We chose SLEAP because we know it best, but the knowledge gained should be applicable to most other pose estimation tools.\n- [@sec-movement-intro]: Analysing motion tracks with [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/)—a Python package we develop [@sirmpilatze_movement_2025]—followed by two case studies on real-world datasets [@sec-movement-mouse; @sec-movement-zebras].\n\n![What we'll cover in this course](img/SLEAP_and_movement.png){#fig-sleap-movement}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nWe want to emphasise that there are many excellent open-source tools beyond those we focus on here.\nThe next section provides a non-exhaustive list of tools that may be useful for your own projects.\n:::\n\n## Useful open-source tools {#sec-useful-tools}\n\n:::
