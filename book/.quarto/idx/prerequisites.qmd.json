Please make sure you install a **Python version >= 3.12** (e.g. 3.12 is fine, 3.10 is not).\n\nYou'll also need a code editor (IDE) configured for Python.  \nIf you already have one you're comfortable with, feel free to use it. Otherwise, we recommend:\n\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)\n- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)\n\n### For the SLEAP tutorial {#sec-install-sleap}\n\nPlease install [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) following the [official installation instructions](https://sleap.ai/installation.html).\n\n::: {.callout-note}  \nFor this workshop, use **SLEAP version 1.3.4**. Be sure to replace the default version number (e.g. `1.4.1`) in the instructions with `1.3.4`.  \n:::\n\nThis should create a `conda` environment named `sleap` with the necessary dependencies. You can verify the installation by running:\n\n```bash\nconda activate sleap\nsleap-label\n```\n\nThis should launch the SLEAP graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n### For the interactive notebooks {#sec-install-movement}\n\nYou will also need a separate `conda` environment with everything required for the interactive exercises, including the [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) packages.\n\nWe recommend cloning this workshop's repository and creating the environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/animals-in-motion.git\ncd animals-in-motion\nconda env create -n animals-in-motion-env -f environment.yaml\n```\n\nTo test your setup, run:\n\n```bash\nconda activate animals-in-motion-env\nmovement launch\n```\n\nThis should open the [movement GUI](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/gui.html), i.e. the [napari](https://napari.org/) image viewer with the `movement` plugin docked on the right.\n\n::: {.callout-note}  \nThere are other ways to [install the movement package](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/installation.html).  \nHowever, for this workshop, we recommend using the `environment.yaml` file to ensure that all necessary dependencies, including those beyond `movement`, are included.  \n:::\n\n## Data {#sec-data}\n\nBringing your own data is encouraged but not required. This could include video recordings of animal behaviour and/or motion tracking data you've previously generated.\n\nWe also provide some example datasets for you to use during the workshop.\nPlease download these from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/81ug5hoy9msc7v7bteqa0/AH32RLdbZqWZJstIeR4YHZY?rlkey=blgagtaizw8aac5areja6h7q1&st=xni448zl&dl=0) before the workshop starts (they are a few GB in size).\n\nThe Dropbox folder is structured as follows:\n\n```txt\nAnimals-in-Motion_2025-08/\n├── CalMS21/\n│   ├── better_model/\n│   │   ├── 250806_174722.centroid.n=679/\n│   │   ├── 250807_162146.multi_class_topdown.n=679/\n│   │   ├── predictions/\n│   │   ├── mouse044_task1_annotator1.test.pkg.slp\n│   │   └── mouse044_task1_annotator1.train.pkg.slp\n│   ├── calms21_task1_train.json\n│   ├── mouse044_task1_annotator1.mp4\n│   ├── mouse044_task1_annotator1.slp\n│   └── readme.md\n└── Smart-Kages.zip\n```\n\n- **CalMS21**: Contains an example video from the [Caltech Mouse Social Interactions (CalMS21) Dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/computational-behavior/our-datasets/calms21-dataset) [@sun_caltech_2021], SLEAP labels and trained models.\n  - **better_model**: SLEAP multi-animal top-down ID model trained on 679 labelled frames.\n    - **250806_174722.centroid.n=679**: Centroid model.\n    - **250807_162146.multi_class_topdown.n=679**: Top-down ID model.\n    - **predictions**: Model predictions on the full video.\n    - **mouse044_task1_annotator1.test.pkg.slp**: Held-out test set containing 2715 labelled frames (80%) randomly sampled from the full annotation file.\n    - **mouse044_task1_annotator1.train.pkg.slp**: Training set containing 679 labelled frames (20%) randomly sampled from the full annotation file.\n  - **calms21_task1_train.json**: MARS [@mars2021] pose estimates provided in the CalMS21 dataset.\n  - **mouse044_task1_annotator1.mp4**: Video file used in [@sec-sleap].\n  - **mouse044_task1_annotator1.slp**: Fully annotated SLEAP labels file containing 3394 labelled frames used in [@sec-movement-intro] (converted from `calms21_task1_train.json`).
