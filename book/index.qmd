## Preface {.unnumbered}

**Animals in Motion** is an online handbook designed for researchers and students interested in learning about free open-source tools for tracking animal motion from video footage and extracting quantitative descriptions of behaviour from motion tracks.

@sec-versions of this handbook have been taught as hands-on workshops in the following settings:

- the [Neuroinformatics Unit Open Software Summer School](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-summer-school/index.html)
- the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre's (SWC) [Systems Neurscience PhD Programme](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/content/systems-neuroscience-phd-programme).

Whether you are attending a workshop in person, or following along the materials at your own pace, be sure to check out @sec-prerequisites.

All materials are shared under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/course-animals-in-motion/blob/main/LICENSE.md) so feel free to use them for your own workshops.
You don't need to ask for permission, but we'd love to hear about it!
We are also always happy to receive feedback and contributions to the handbook, see @sec-contributing.

## Funding & acknowledgements

The inaugural [Open Software Week](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-summer-school/2025/index.html),
which served as an impetus for creating this handbook, was made possible by a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellowship to **Niko Sirmpilatze**, as well as further funding support by the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/), the [Society for Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/) and [AIBIO-UK](https://aibio.ac.uk/).

We thank the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) and the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) for providing facilities for the workshops.
