## Preface {.unnumbered}

**Animals in Motion** is an online handbook that introduces free, open-source tools for tracking animal motion from videos and extracting quantitative descriptions of behaviour from motion tracks.

[Earlier @sec-versions] of this handbook have been taught as hands-on workshops in the following settings:

- the [Neuroinformatics Unit Open Software Summer School](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-summer-school/index.html)
- the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre's (SWC) [Systems Neurscience PhD Programme](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/content/systems-neuroscience-phd-programme).

Whether you are attending a workshop in person, or following along the materials at your own pace, be sure to check out @sec-prerequisites.

All materials are shared under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/course-animals-in-motion/blob/main/LICENSE.md) so you are welcome to use and adapt them for your own workshops.
There is no need to ask for permission, but we'd love to hear about it if you do!
Feedback and contributions to the handbook are always welcome, see @sec-contributing.
