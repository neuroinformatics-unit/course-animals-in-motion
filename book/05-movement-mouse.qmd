# A mouse's daily activity log {#sec-movement-mouse}

In this case study, we'll be using the [`movement` package](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) to dive into mouse home cage monitoring data acquired in [Smart-Kages](https://cambridgephenotyping.com/products) and tracked with [DeepLabCut](https://www.deeplabcut.org/). We'll explore how mouse activity levels fluctuate throughout the day.

Before you get started, make sure you've set up the `animals-in-motion-env` environment (refer to [prerequisites @sec-install-movement]) and are using it to run this code. You'll also need to download the `Smart-Kages.zip` archive from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/81ug5hoy9msc7v7bteqa0/AH32RLdbZqWZJstIeR4YHZY?rlkey=blgagtaizw8aac5areja6h7q1&st=w1zueyi9&dl=0) (see [prerequisites @sec-data]) and unzip it.

## The Smart-Kages dataset

::: {.callout-note title="Acknowledgement"}
This dataset was kindly shared by [Loukia Katsouri](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/loukia-katsouri) from the [O'Keefe Lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/okeefe-lab), with permission to use for this workshop.
:::

The Smart-Kages dataset comprises home cage recordings from two mice,
each housed in a specialised [Smart-Kage](https://cambridgephenotyping.com/products) [@ho_fully_2023]—a home cage
monitoring system equipped with a camera mounted atop the cage.

The camera captures data around the clock at a rate of 2 frames per second, saving a video
segment for each hour of the day. A pre-trained DeepLabCut model is subsequently employed
to predict 8 keypoints on the mouse's body.

Let's examine the contents of the downloaded data.
You will need to specify the path to the unzipped `Smart-Kages` folder on your machine.

```{python}
# Replace with the path to the unzipped Smart-Kages folder on your machine
smart_kages_path = Path.home() / ".movement" / "Smart-Kages"

# Let's visualise the contents of the folder
files = [f.name for f in smart_kages_path.iterdir()]
files.sort()
for file in files:
    print(file)
```

The tracking data are stored in two`.nc` (NetCDF) files: `kage14` and `kage17`.
NetCDF is an HDF5-based file format that can be natively saved/loaded by the `xarray` library, and is therefore [convenient to use with `movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/input_output.html#native-saving-and-loading-with-netcdf).

Apart from these, we also have two `.png` files: `kage14_background.png` and `kage17_background.png`, which constitute frames extracted from the videos.

Let's take a look at them.

```{python}
#| label: fig-background-frames
#| fig-cap: "Top-down camera views of the Smart-Kage habitats"
#| code-fold: true

kages = ["kage14", "kage17"]
img_paths = [smart_kages_path / f"{kage}_background.png" for kage in kages]
images = [plt.imread(img_path) for img_path in img_paths]

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 5))

for i, img in enumerate(images):
    axes[i].imshow(img)
    axes[i].set_title(f"{kages[i]}")
    axes[i].axis("off")

```

::: {.callout-tip title="Questions A"}

1. What objects do you see in the habitat?
2. What challenges do you anticipate with tracking a mouse in this environment?
3. What are the trade-offs one has to consider when designing a continuous monitoring system?
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="answers"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Click to reveal the answers" collapse="true"}

1. The habitat contains several objects, including the mouse's nest, a running wheel, a climbing platform, a toilet paper roll, and a corridor with two arms near the top.
2. The presence of these objects is likely to cause occlusions, meaning the mouse or parts of it may frequently be obscured from the camera's view.
3. The requirements for animal welfare, such as providing a rich environment, often conflict with the needs of the tracking system. While a single black mouse on a white background would be straightforward to track, such conditions would not support the mouse's well-being over time, nor would they yield naturalistic behavior.
:::

:::

Let's load and inspect the tracking data:

```{python}
ds_kages = {}  # a dictionary to store kage name -> xarray dataset

for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    ds_kages[kage] = xr.open_dataset(smart_kages_path / f"{kage}.nc")

ds_kages["kage14"]   # Change to "kage17" to inspect the other dataset
```

We see that each dataset contains a huge amount of data, but the two datasets are
not exactly aligned in time.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true

start_times = {
    name: pd.Timestamp(ds.time.isel(time=0).values)
    for name, ds in ds_kages.items()
}
end_times = {
    name: pd.Timestamp(ds.time.isel(time=-1).values)
    for name, ds in ds_kages.items()
}

for name in start_times.keys():
    print(f"{name}: from {start_times[name]} to {end_times[name]}")
```

## Datetime Coordinates

You might notice something interesting about the time coordinates in these `xarray` datasets: they're given in `datetime64[ns]` format, which means they're precise timestamps expressed in "calendar time".

This is different from what we've seen before in other `movement` datasets, where time coordinates are expressed as seconds elapsed since the start of the video, or "elapsed time".

::: {.callout-note title="How did we get these timestamps?" collapse="true"}

Many recording systems can output timestamps for each video frame. In our case, the raw data from the Smart-Kage system included the start datetime of each 1-hour-long video segment and the precise time difference between the start of each segment and every frame within it.

Using this information, we were able to reconstruct precise datetime coordinates for all frames throughout the entire experiment. We then concatenated the DeepLabCut predictions from all video segments and assigned the datetime coordinates to the resulting dataset. If you're interested in the details, you can find the code in the [smart-kages-movement GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/smart-kages-movement).

:::

Using "calendar time" is convenient for many applications.
For example, we could cross-reference the tracking results against other data sources, such as body weight measurements.

It also allows us to easily select time windows by datetime.
We will leverage this here to select a time window that's common to both kages.
Note that we discard the last few days because the experimenter introduced
some interventions during that time, which are out of scope for this case study.

```{python}
#| output: false

common_start = "2024-04-09 00:00:00"
common_end = "2024-05-07 00:00:00"

for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    ds_kages[kage] = ds_kages[kage].sel(time=slice(common_start, common_end))
```

Beyond this ability to select time windows by date and time,
we will see many other benefits of using datetime coordinates in the rest of this case study.

That said, it's still useful to also know the total time elapsed since the start of the experiment.
In fact, many `movement` functions will expect "elapsed time" and may not work with datetime coordinates (for now).

Luckily, it's easy to convert datetime coordinates to "elapsed time" by simply subtracting the start datetime of the whole experiment from each timestamp.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Expand to see how this can be done"

ds_14 = ds_kages["kage14"]

# Get the start datetime the experiment in kage14
experiment_start = ds_14.time.isel(time=0).data

# Subtract the start datetime from each timestamp
time_elapsed = (ds_14.time.data - np.datetime64(experiment_start))

# Convert to seconds
seconds_elapsed = time_elapsed / pd.Timedelta("1s")

# Assign the seconds_elapsed coordinate to the "time" dimension
ds_14 = ds_14.assign_coords(seconds_elapsed=("time", seconds_elapsed))
```

We've pre-computed this for convenience and stored it in a secondary time coordinate called `seconds_elapsed`.

```{python}
print(ds_14.coords["time"].values[:2])
print(ds_14.coords["seconds_elapsed"].values[:2])
```

Whenever we want to switch to "elapsed time" mode, we can simply set the `seconds_elapsed` coordinates as the "index" of the `time` dimension. This means that `seconds_elapsed` will be used as the primary time coordinate, allowing us to select data by it.

```{python}
#| output: false

ds_14.set_index(time="seconds_elapsed").sel(time=slice(0, 1800))
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Exercise A"}

For each of the two kages:

1. Plot the x-axis position of the mouse's body center over time, for the week starting on April 15th. What do you notice?
2. Plot the median confidence of the body center for each day, over the entire duration of the experiment.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="answers"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Click to reveal the answers" collapse="true"}

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 6), sharex=True)

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    ds = ds_kages[kage].squeeze()  # remove redundant "individuals" dimension
    body_center = ds.position.sel(
        keypoints="bodycenter",
        time=slice("2024-04-15 00:00:00", "2024-04-21 23:59:59"),
        space="x"
    )
    body_center.plot.line(ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f"{kage} body center x")
```

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 6), sharex=True)

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    ds = ds_kages[kage].squeeze()
    ds_daily = ds.resample(time="1D").median()
    ds_daily.confidence.sel(keypoints="bodycenter").plot.line(ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f"{kage} body center")
```

:::

:::

## Cleaning the data

Let's examine the range of confidence values for each keypoint.

```{python}
#| label: fig-confidence-range
#| fig-cap: "Confidence range by keypoint"
#| code-fold: true

kage = "kage14"
confidence = ds_kages[kage].confidence.squeeze()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
confidence.quantile(q=0.25, dim="time").plot.line("o--", color="gray", ax=ax, label="25% quantile")
confidence.quantile(q=0.75, dim="time").plot.line("o--", color="gray", ax=ax, label="75% quantile")
confidence.median(dim="time").plot.line("o-", color="black", ax=ax, label="median")

ax.legend()
ax.set_title(f"{kage} confidence range")
plt.show()
```

It looks like the "neck", "bodycenter", "spine1", and "spine2" keypoints
are the most confidently detected.
Let us define a list of "reliable" keypoints for later use.
These are all on the mouse's body.

```{python}
reliable_keypoints = ["neck", "bodycenter", "spine1", "spine2"]
```

We can filter out low-confidence predictions.

```{python}
confidence_threshold = 0.95

for kage, ds in ds_kages.items():
    ds["position_filtered"] = filter_by_confidence(
        ds.position,
        ds.confidence,
        threshold=confidence_threshold,
    )
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Exercise B"}

Let's smooth the data with a rolling median filter.

_Hint_: Look up the `rolling_filter` function in the `movement.filtering` module.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="answers"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Click to reveal the answers" collapse="true"}

```{python}
window_size = 3  # frames

for kage, ds in ds_kages.items():
    ds["position_smoothed"] = rolling_filter(
        ds.position_filtered,
        window_size,
        statistic="median",
    )
```

:::

:::

## Plot the mouse's speed over time

Let's define a single-point representation of the mouse's position, which we'll call the `body_centroid`.
We derive this by taking the mean of the 4 reliable keypoints, using their smoothed positions.

```{python}
for kage, ds in ds_kages.items():
    ds["body_centroid"] = ds.position_filtered.sel(
        individuals="individual_0",  # the only individual in the dataset
        keypoints=reliable_keypoints
    ).mean(dim="keypoints")
```

Next, we'll compute the body centroid's speed in cm/sec via the following steps:

1. Convert the body centroid position data to cm units using `movement.transforms.scale`.
2. Temporarily switch to "elapsed time" mode, because `compute_speed` does not (yet) support datetime coordinates.
3. Compute the speed in cm/sec
4. Restore the original datetime coordinates to the speed data.

```{python}
PIXELS_PER_CM = 10

for kage, ds in ds_kages.items():
    # Scale from pixels to cm using a known conversion factor
    body_centroid_cm = scale(
        ds.body_centroid, factor=1 / PIXELS_PER_CM, space_unit="cm"
    )

    # Compute the speed in cm/sec
    ds["body_centroid_speed"] = compute_speed(
       body_centroid_cm.set_index(time="seconds_elapsed")  # switch time coords
    ).assign_coords(time=body_centroid_cm.time)            # restore datetime

ds_kages["kage14"].body_centroid_speed
```

Let's plot the speed over time.

```{python}
#| label: fig-body-speed
#| fig-cap: "Body centroid speed"

fig, axes = plt.subplots(
    nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True
)

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    ds_kages[kage].body_centroid_speed.plot.line(ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f"{kage} body centroid")
    axes[i].set_ylabel("speed (cm/sec)")

plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Questions B"}

1. What are potential sources of error in the speed calculation?
2. What do you notice about the overall speed fluctuations over time? What do you think is the reason for this?
3. Do you notice any differences between the two kages? Feel free to "zoom in" on specific time windows to investigate this.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="answers"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Click to reveal the answers" collapse="true"}

_Potential sources of error in speed calculation:_ The accuracy of speed computation is heavily reliant on precise position data. Any inaccuracies in predicting keypoint positions (i.e., the discrepancy between actual and estimated positions) can be exacerbated when calculating speed, as it is derived from the differences between consecutive positions. Additionally, we have assumed a fixed conversion factor of 10 pixels per cm. While this value may be accurate for the habitat's floor, the environment is not entirely flat. It includes objects for climbing, which means the conversion factor will vary depending on the mouse's vertical position (distance from the camera).

The speed seems to fluctuate in a circadian pattern, especially apparent in kage14.
This will become clearer if we zoom in on a time window of a few days.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true

time_window = slice("2024-04-22", "2024-04-26")

fig, axes = plt.subplots(
    nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True
)

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    speed = ds_kages[kage].body_centroid_speed.sel(time=time_window)
    speed.plot.line(ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f"{kage} body centroid")
    axes[i].set_ylabel("speed (pixels/sec)")

plt.show()

```

We also note that the circadian pattern is more pronounced in kage14,
and seems to be somewhat disrupted in kage17. The mouse in kage17
seems to be more active overall, both during the day and at night.
:::

:::

::: {.callout-note title="A side-note on 3D pose estimation" collapse="true"}

With only a single top-down view of the mouse, we are limited to 2D pose estimation.
This means the estimated keypoint coordinates are simply projections of the true 3D coordinates onto the 2D image plane.

This is the most common approach to pose estimation, but it cannot accurately measure true dimensions.
Any conversion from pixels to physical units (e.g. centimetres) will be imprecise, and sometimes significantly so.

This limitation can be overcome by using multiple cameras from different viewpoints and performing 3D pose estimation.
There are two main markerless approaches:

1. The first approach is to do 'regular' 2D pose estimation in each camera view,
   then triangulate across camera views to estimate 3D pose. The triangulation
   relies on known parameters about the cameras and their relative positions
   and orientations. [Anipose](https://anipose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   [@karashchuk_anipose_2021-1] is a popular open-source toolkit that
   implements this approach.

   ![Source: @pereira_quantifying_2020](img/pose_estimation_3d.png)

2. The second approach, implemented in [DANNCE](https://github.com/spoonsso/dannce)
   [@dunn_geometric_2021], is to use a fully 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that
   can learn about 3D image features and how cameras and landmarks
   relate to one another in 3D space.

   ![Source: <https://github.com/spoonsso/dannce>](img/DANNCE.png)

Some __prompts for discussion__:

- What are the pros and cons of 2D vs 3D markerless pose estimation?
- In which scenarios would you prefer one over the other?

## Plot actograms

An actogram is a visualisation of the mouse's activity level over time.

As a measure of activity we'll use the cumulative distance traversed
by the mouse's body centroid in a given time bin—in this case, 10 minutes.
Since we have already computed the speed (cm/sec), we can multiply that by the time bin duration in seconds to get the distance (cm).

```{python}
for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    time_diff = ds_kages[kage].coords["seconds_elapsed"].diff(dim="time")
    ds_kages[kage]["distance"] = ds_kages[kage].body_centroid_speed * time_diff

```

Then we can sum the distance traversed in each time bin to get the activity level.

```{python}
#| label: fig-activity-levels
#| fig-cap: "Activity over time"

time_bin_minutes = 10
time_bin_duration = pd.Timedelta(f"{time_bin_minutes}min")

fig, ax = plt.subplots(
    nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True
)

activity_dict = {}  # Dictionary to store the activity levels for each kage

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    activity = ds_kages[kage].distance.resample(time=time_bin_duration).sum()
    activity.plot.line(ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_title(f"{kage} activity")
    ax[i].set_ylabel("distance (cm)")
    ax[i].set_xlabel("time")

    activity_dict[kage] = activity

plt.show()
```

To make any circadian patterns more apparent, we will stack days vertically
and indicate the light cycle with gray areas.
For this particular experiment, the light cycle is as follows:

- lights off at 9:30
- dawn at 20:30
- lights on at 21:30

```{python}
# Define light cycle (in minutes since midnight)
lights_off = 9 * 60 + 30  # 9:30 AM in minutes
dawn = 20 * 60 + 30       # 8:30 PM in minutes  
lights_on = 21 * 60 + 30  # 9:30 PM in minutes

n_bins_in_day = int(24 * 60 / time_bin_minutes)

actogram_dict = {}  # Dictionary to store the 2D actogram for each kage

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    activity = activity_dict[kage]
    days = list(activity.groupby("time.date").groups.keys())

    # Create an empty 2D actogram with dims (date, time_bin)
    actogram = xr.DataArray(
        np.zeros((len(days), n_bins_in_day)),
        dims=["date", "time_of_day"],
        coords={
            "date": days,
            "time_of_day": np.arange(
                time_bin_minutes/2, 24 * 60, time_bin_minutes
            )
        },
    )
    # Populate 2D actogram per day
    for date, day_activity in activity.groupby("time.date"):
        actogram.loc[dict(date=date)] = day_activity.values

    # Store the actogram in the dictionary for later use
    actogram_dict[kage] = actogram

actogram_dict["kage14"]  # Replace with kage17 to see the actogram for kage17
```

Let's now visualise the actograms, with the light cycle marked.

## Space occupancy

Apart from quantifying how active the mice were over time, we might also
be interested in which parts of the habitat they tend to frequent.

`movement` provides a [`plot_occupancy()`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/api/movement.plots.plot_occupancy.html) function to help us visualise the space occupancy.

```{python}
#| label: fig-occupancy1
#| fig-cap: "Occupancy heatmaps"

fig, axes = plt.subplots(
    nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(8, 8), sharex=True, sharey=True
)

plt.suptitle("Body centroid occupancy (log scale)")

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    img = images[i]
    height, width = img.shape[:2]

    axes[i].imshow(img)
    plot_occupancy(
        # Setting the time coordinates to "elapsed time" is necessary
        # for the log scale to work properly.
        ds_kages[kage].body_centroid.set_index(time="seconds_elapsed"),
        ax=axes[i],
        cmap="turbo",
        norm="log",  # log scale the colormap
        vmax=10**6,
        alpha=0.6,   # some transparency
    )
    # Make axes match the image dimensions
    axes[i].set_ylim([height - 1, 0])
    axes[i].set_xlim([0, width])
    axes[i].set_title(kage)
```

We see some clear hotspots, such as the nest and climbing platform.
But not all hotspots are created equal.
For example, the nest should be occupied when the mouse is stationary but
not when it is moving.

To investigate this, let's choose an arbitrary speed limit of 4 cm/sec, below which we consider the mouse to be stationary.

```{python}

::: {.callout-note}
We use the log scale because speeds tend to be exponentially distributed,
i.e. the mouse spends far more time at low speeds than at high speeds.
Try commenting out the `ax.set_yscale("log")` line and see what happens.

We will generate separate occupancy heatmaps for when the mouse is stationary and moving.
We can do this by [masking with `where()`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/indexing.html#masking-with-where).

```{python}
stationary_mask = ds_kages["kage14"].body_centroid_speed < 4
stationary_mask
```

A "mask" is just a boolean array of the same shape as the original data.
It's `True` where the condition is met, and `False` otherwise.

```{python}
stationary_position = ds_kages["kage14"].body_centroid.where(stationary_mask)
stationary_position
```

We see that the `where()` method returns a new `xarray.DataArray` with the same dimensions as the original, but with the data values replaced by `NaN` where the condition (mask) is `False`.

Using this approach we can generate separate occupancy heatmaps for when the mouse is stationary vs active.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-occupancy2
#| fig-cap: "Occupancy heatmaps (stationary vs active)"

fig, axes = plt.subplots(
    nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(12, 8), sharex=True, sharey=True
)

plt.suptitle("Body centroid occupancy (log scale)")

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    img = images[i]
    height, width = img.shape[:2]

    masks = {
        "stationary": ds_kages[kage].body_centroid_speed < 4,
        "moving": ds_kages[kage].body_centroid_speed >= 4,
    }

    for j, (mask_name, mask) in enumerate(masks.items()):
        ax = axes[i, j]
        ax.imshow(img)
        plot_occupancy(
            ds_kages[kage].body_centroid.where(mask).set_index(time="seconds_elapsed"),
            ax=ax,
            cmap="turbo",
            norm="log",
            vmax=10**6,
            alpha=0.6,
        )
        ax.set_title(f"{kage} {mask_name}")
        ax.set_ylim([height - 1, 0])
        ax.set_xlim([0, width])

plt.show()

```

We see some expected patterns like the nest being a "hotspot" during stationary periods,
and going "dark" during active periods. But we also see some puzzling patterns:
for example, the running wheel is occupied during both periods, including when the mouse is "stationary".

Is that because the mouse appears to be stationary to the camera as it's
running "in-place" of the wheel (like on a treadmill)? Or maybe the mouse
spends some of its downtime resting on the wheel?

Let us precisely measure the % of time the mouse spends on the running wheel.
Here we'll use `movement`'s [functionality of defining regions of interest (ROIs)](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/api/movement.roi.html).

Let us create a circular "running wheel" ROI for each of the two kages.

```{python}

from movement.roi import PolygonOfInterest

centres = {
    "kage14": np.array([145, 260]),  # (x, y)
    "kage17": np.array([385, 210]),
}
radius = 70

# Create a unit circle
n_points = 32
angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n_points)
unit_circle = np.column_stack([np.cos(angles), np.sin(angles)])

# Create ROIs by scaling and shifting the unit circle
rois = {}
for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    points = centres[kage] + radius * unit_circle
    roi = PolygonOfInterest(points, name=f"{kage} running wheel")
    rois[kage] = roi
```

Let's verify that the ROIs are roughly in the right place.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-rois
#| fig-cap: "Running wheel ROIs"

fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 8))

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    img = images[i]
    ax[i].imshow(img)
    rois[kage].plot(ax=ax[i], alpha=0.25, facecolor="red")
    ax[i].legend()

plt.show()
```

Now that we have the ROIs defined as `PolygonOfInterest` objects, we can
use some built-in methods:

```{python}
roi_occupancy = {
    kage: rois[kage].contains_point(ds_kages[kage].body_centroid)
    for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]
}

roi_occupancy["kage14"]
```

The occupancy data is an array which is `True` whena point
(in this case the mouse's body centroid at each time point)
is inside the ROI, and `False` otherwise.

```{python}
#| label: fig-roi-occupancy-line
#| fig-cap: "Running wheel occupancy as a function of time"

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
roi_occupancy["kage14"].plot.line(ax=ax)
ax.set_title("Running wheel occupancy (kage14)")
ax.set_ylabel("Occupancy (%)")
```

We can also compute the % of time the mouse spends on the running wheel.

```{python}
for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    on_wheel = roi_occupancy[kage].sum(dim="time").values
    total_time = roi_occupancy[kage].time.notnull().sum(dim="time").values
    pct_on_wheel = float(100 * on_wheel / total_time)
    print(f"{kage} spends {pct_on_wheel:.1f}% of its time on the running wheel")
```

But how does the running wheel occupancy relate the light cycle?
We can segment occupancy into light and dark periods for each day
and compute the % of time spent on the running wheel during each period.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true

days = list(roi_occupancy["kage14"].groupby("time.date").groups.keys())
n_days = len(days)

daily_occupancy = xr.DataArray(
    np.full((2, n_days, 2), np.nan),  # (kage, date, period) with NaNs
    dims=["kage", "date", "period"],
    coords={
        "kage": ["kage14", "kage17"],
        "date": days,
        "period": ["dark", "light"]
    },
)

for kage in ["kage14", "kage17"]:
    for date, day_ds in roi_occupancy[kage].groupby("time.date"):
        dark_period = slice(f"{date} 09:30:00", f"{date} 21:30:00")
        light_period1 = slice(f"{date} 00:00:00", f"{date} 09:30:00")
        light_period2 = slice(f"{date} 21:30:00", f"{date} 23:59:59")

        n_total_frames = day_ds.time.notnull().sum().values
        if n_total_frames == 0:
            continue

        n_dark_frames = day_ds.time.sel(time=dark_period).notnull().sum().values
        n_light_frames = n_total_frames - n_dark_frames

        dark_occupancy = 100 * day_ds.sel(time=dark_period).sum() / n_dark_frames
        light_occupancy = 100 * (
            day_ds.sel(time=light_period1).sum() +
            day_ds.sel(time=light_period2).sum()
        ) / n_light_frames

        daily_occupancy.loc[dict(kage=kage, date=date, period="dark")] = dark_occupancy
        daily_occupancy.loc[dict(kage=kage, date=date, period="light")] = light_occupancy
```

```{python}
daily_occupancy
```

Let's visualise the % of time spent on the running wheel during the light and dark periods of each day.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-roi-occupancy
#| fig-cap: "Running wheel occupancy during light and dark periods"

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True)

max_occupancy = daily_occupancy.max()

for i, kage in enumerate(["kage14", "kage17"]):
    daily_occupancy.sel(kage=kage).plot(
        ax=axes[i], lw=3, vmax=daily_occupancy.max(), yincrease=False
    )

    axes[i].set_title(f"{kage} running wheel occupancy")
    axes[i].set_xticks([0.25, 0.75])
    axes[i].set_ylabel("Occupancy (%)")
    axes[i].set_xlabel("Period")

plt.show()
```
